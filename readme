graph-ui

short description:

this tool can be used to draw a directed graph in the graph view on the left
and to print corresponding source code in the source view on the right.
the source code is given by very simple statements of the form 

'graph.edge(2, 3).setDistance(5);'

for each edge, which can be parsed to create the graph. use the arrow buttons
to sync the two views. nodes and edges can also be added by clicking the graph
(see instructions below the graph). so far the edge weights and node labels 
can only be modified in the source view.

installation:

* run 'npm install' from a command line
* see the scripts in package.json to build the app
* for example run 'npm run bundle' for the production version and
  open app/index.html from a browser (tested with Firefox 49)
* to run the tests run 'npm run testBundle' and open spec/specRunner.html from 
  a browser
